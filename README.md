# Introduction

Hello, this is my test React App to demonstrate my knowledge and skills.\
Before one can begin to review this project, it's important to have the right dependencies implemented.\
If you have not worked with the React App before, please refer below to "Getting Started with Create React App" for more information.

## Dependencies

There are a few extra dependencies to implement before one can operate the application.\
Fortunately, there are only a few lines of command inputs to set this up.

`npm i bootstrap@5.3.2`\
`npm i react-router-dom`\
`npm i react-hook-form`

While not functional at this point, this will be later implemented and can be put in to future proof.

`npm i jsonwebtoken`\
`npm i dotenv`

## Showcase

### Header And Footer

Implemented a header and footer for all pages.

### Navigation Links

This is a demonstration into how to set up navigation on an application, and how to implement nested navigation within navigated links.

### Register and Login

A basic implementation to create an account, set an email and password, then to successfully sign in with the new account.\
Later implmentations will work incorporate security to protect passwords and accounts.

### Buttons

Implemented alert buttons, as well as functions to have counters, both synchronised and independently operated.

### Tables
#### Elvish Age Table

This is a table that showcases the aging rate of Tolkien's elves from his Legendarium.\
This table presents the workings of these ages as generated rows, each entering the appropriate values based on their lifecycle, as well as the different iterations by Tolkien.
Plan to implement options for the table to be interactive, how many rows / what age an elf is at X, etc.

### Games
#### Tic-Tac-Toe

Basic implementation of Tic-Tac-toe, from this [Tic-Tac-Toe Tutorial](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe) from React.
Intend to improve presentations with bootstrap.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
